# 2D-Interacting-particles
Result of my curiosity to simulate a multi-particle interacting system
The archived repository named 2D semi interacting partciles was my first try at such a system.
This is a much more refined energy conserving system. The interactions are moddeled using normal coloumb repuslsion.
 
The total energy for the system is conserved with proper choise of time step. 
The motivation of doing a multi particle interaction/collision study was to understand whether the system will go to an 
equiloibrium temperature. This came from my interactions with fellow researchers who work on crystal lattices. 
Such a temeparture stabilization is seen in this basic simulation.
Now the question is whether this temerature equiloibriation has something to do with order in chaos.

An attaractive interaction can be modelled using a morse type interaction. 
A couloumbic attaraction tends to blow up as 2 partciles reach very close.
A morse type interaction can be implemented. 
A Morse-potential/LJ-potential is a suitable candidate for future modelling
