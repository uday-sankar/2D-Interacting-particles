# 2D-Interacting-particles
Result of my curiosity to simulate a multi-particle interacting system
The archived repository named 2D semi interacting partciles was my first try at such a system.
This is a much more refined energy conserving system. The interactions are moddeled using normal coloumb repuslsion.
An attaractive interaction can be modelled using a morse type interaction. 
A couloumbic attaraction tend to blow up the energy of the system as they reach infnitesimally close.
A morse type interaction can be implimented.
